/**
 * You are given two arrays of integers a and b, which are both sorted in ascending order and contain unique elements (i.e. no duplicates).
 *
 * You can take several (possibly zero) numbers from the array b and add them to a at any positions in any order.
 *
 * You want the array a to be an arithmetic progression after this.
 *
 * Your task is to find the maximal length of the resulting arithmetic progression represented by array a that can be achieved.
 *
 * If it is impossible to obtain an array forming an arithmetic progression, return -1.
